MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Discussion with Warren Commission Staff Member

REFERENCE: Letter from J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the President's Commission, to Mr. Richard Helms dated 3 July 1964

With the approval of C/SR and the DDP, I met with Mr. David Slawson of the staff of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy at 1400 hours on this date in the Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies in material provided to the Commission by CIA and by the Department of State, which were called to our attention in a letter from the General Counsel of the Commission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.

By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the Commission's report that he was writing, he would have to deal with the question of whether or not the OSWALDS' departure from the USSR—and the circumstances (i.e., timing) of that departure—were unusual or suspicious in any way. He expressed his belief that they probably were not and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters in the post-Stalin era. However, he wanted to be sure in his own mind that our information was not in conflict with that which the Commission had received from State since all of that information would remain in the records of the Commission.

After stating my belief that there was no real disagreement or inconsistency between the information from CIA and that from State, I expressed the view that the matter resolved itself into three questions:

a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals to emigrate from the Soviet Union to the homelands of their spouses?

b. Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to accompany (i.e., depart simultaneously with) their spouses from the Soviet Union?

c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get Soviet exit visas for such a purpose (time lapse from application to granting of visas)?
a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals to emigrate from the Soviet Union to the homelands of their spouses?

b. Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to accompany (i.e., depart simultaneously with) their spouses from the Soviet Union?

c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get Soviet exit visas for such a purpose (time lapse from application to granting of visas)?

4. Regarding the first two questions (3a and 3b above), I explained that we primarily focused on the issue of Soviet citizens being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad, while the State Department addressed the broader question of Soviets married to foreigners being allowed to emigrate, without specifying whether they left simultaneously or at a different time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson found this explanation helpful and reread both our and State's statements with this perspective.

5. To elaborate, I mentioned that the statements in paragraph 6 of our memorandum dated 6 April 1964, concerning Soviets being permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad, were based on a review of 26 cases, 10 of which involved Americans. In only four of these cases did a Soviet wife leave the USSR with her foreign husband; in 14 cases, the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the remaining seven cases, insufficient details were available to categorize them. I also noted that while the State Department's information began by citing the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December 1963, it did not specify how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens married to U.S. nationals. In fact, State provided detailed information for only 16 cases and did not clarify in many of these whether the Soviet citizen was allowed to accompany the foreign spouse.

6. In response to a question from Mr. Slawson, I stated that most of the 26 cases upon which we based our statements involved foreign students, exchange teachers, and other relatively transient persons. While a number of cases have certain points in common, they bear little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none involved a defector who married prior to repatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April 1964 memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson indicated that he was now satisfied on this matter.

7. Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to process exit visas for Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals (question 3c above), I stated that, in my opinion, the information provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter) substantially corresponded to the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7 of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson asked if it would be possible to elaborate on paragraph 7 of our memorandum of 6 April by providing a statistical breakdown of the cases on which our statements were based. I indicated that this could be done.

8. At this point, Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion, he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies had been resolved. However, he asked that we send a brief written reply to the Commission's letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning the basis for statements included in our 6 April 1964 memorandum. [This would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet visa applications.]

9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to CIA for checking as to their accuracy. He did not say when this would occur.

10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Slawson, I read Volume 52 of the transcript of testimony before the Commission. This included the reinterview of Marina OSWALD.

  - **Allen David Packier**
  - **Tea Kroksjo**
  - **John Sandor**  
	 *(Note: Sandor wanted to take his spouse out of the USSR before marriage, but she was still technically married to someone else. He had to return later to marry her and await the granting of an exit visa.)*

- **Foreign National Left USSR Without Soviet Spouse**:
  - **Arlene Sterk-Zasuvievich**
  - **Leonard Kirsch**
  - **Clark Olsen**
  - **Philip Nielson**
  - **Thomas Hegarty**
  - **Robert Tucker**
  - **Luciano Bassani**

  - **C. Grant Perill**
  - **Alvaro Cruz Ocampo**
  - **Ruggiero Grieco**
  - **Asser Uvikkala**
  - **Achillefs Lymbourides**

#### Observations

- In the majority of cases, the foreign spouse left the USSR without their Soviet partner.  
- Cases where the Soviet spouse accompanied the foreign national were rare and often involved significant delays or complications, such as awaiting exit visas.  
- In some instances, the sequence of departure remains unclear due to insufficient details.

#### Additional Notes

- The legality and normality of Soviet citizens accompanying foreign spouses were assessed based on these cases.  
- The rapidity with which L.H. Oswald and Marina Oswald were able to leave the USSR was considered unusual compared to the reviewed cases.

### Summary of Soviet Spouse Visa Cases

#### Key Points:
1. **Cases of Soviet Spouses Accompanying Foreign Nationals**:
	- In only **4 cases** did the Soviet spouse accompany their foreign partner out of the USSR.
	- Example: A Swedish student married a Soviet student and brought her out of the USSR.

2. **Cases Where Foreign Nationals Departed Alone**:
	- In **14 cases**, the foreign spouse left the USSR without their Soviet partner.
	- Example: In one case, the Soviet spouse was delayed due to imprisonment for travel violations.

3. **Unknown Departure Sequence**:
	- In **7 cases**, the sequence of departure is unclear.

#### Visa Processing Times:
- The length of time for Soviet authorities to process exit visas for Soviet spouses of American citizens aligns with CIA's conclusions in the **6 April 1964 memorandum**.
- Additional data from the State Department provides further insights but does not materially alter the conclusions.

#### Observations:
- Apparent inconsistencies between CIA and State Department data may stem from differing approaches to the issue.
- CIA agreed to provide a statistical breakdown of cases to clarify its statements.

#### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that Soviet authorities rarely allowed simultaneous departures of Soviet spouses with their foreign partners, and visa processing times varied significantly.
### 6 April 1964 Memorandum Summary

#### Key Points:

1. **Simultaneous Departure of Soviet Citizens with Foreign Spouses**:
	- Based on a review of 26 cases (10 involving Americans), only **3 cases** involved Soviet wives leaving the USSR simultaneously with their husbands.
	- In **2 cases**, an American met his future wife during a visit to the USSR, married her on a subsequent trip, and brought her back to the U.S.
	- The third case involved a Swedish student who married a Soviet student and apparently brought her out with him.
	- In **14 cases**, the Soviet wife preceded her husband or the foreign spouse departed alone, often due to delays caused by travel violations or other complications.
	- In **7 cases**, the sequence of departure is unknown.

2. **Visa Processing Times**:
	- The time taken by Soviet authorities to process exit visas for Soviet wives of foreign nationals aligns with the conclusions expressed in the **6 April 1964 memorandum**.
	- In **11 cases**, the time period is known or can be inferred:
	  - **3 cases**: 5 to 9 months.
	  - **3 cases**: Approximately 6 months.
	  - **2 cases**: 9 to 11 months.
	  - **3 cases**: 7 to 12 months.
	- Apparent inconsistencies between CIA and State Department statistics likely arise from differing approaches to the issue.

3. **Additional Observations**:
	- In some cases, there were delays of several months between the application for an exit visa and its issuance:
	  - Example: In one case, the process took 5 months; in another, 6 months; and in a third, 9 months.
	- In one instance, a foreign husband was required to leave the USSR without his Soviet wife, as her exit application could not be processed until after his departure. Her visa was issued 6 weeks later, though it had not been applied for at the time of their marriage or during the subsequent 6 months.

#### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that simultaneous departures of Soviet spouses with their foreign partners were rare, and visa processing times varied significantly depending on the circumstances.
#### Approximate Time Limits for Granting Soviet Exit Visas

Based on available data, the following timeframes were observed for the issuance of Soviet exit visas:

1. **First Case**: Visa granted within 4 to 5 months.
2. **Second Case**: Visa granted within 6 months.
3. **Third Case**: Visa granted within 9 months.
4. **Fourth Case**: Visa granted within 12 months.

In three additional cases, the minimum time for visa issuance ranged between 11 and 12 months, respectively.

#### Observations

- The time required for processing exit visas varied significantly depending on the circumstances of each case.
- Delays were common, with some cases taking nearly a year to resolve.

This data highlights the challenges faced by individuals seeking exit visas during this period.

### Observations on Soviet-American Marriages and Visa Policies

#### Key Points:
1. **Challenges in American-Soviet Marriages**:
	- A State Department official noted that all American-Soviet marriages had historically been unsuccessful.
	- Soviet authorities rarely allowed their nationals to marry foreigners unless there were ulterior motives, such as recruitment for espionage.

2. **Soviet Visa Policies**:
	- The Soviets were unlikely to grant exit visas to their nationals under circumstances involving marriage to a foreigner unless the individual had been recruited as a spy.
	- Delays and denials were common, with individuals often waiting months or years without success.

3. **Espionage Concerns**:
	- Soviet women associating with or marrying foreign men were often recruited by State Security (KGB) at various stages of their relationships.
	- Even if only a small percentage of these women were fully loyal to State Security, the Soviets considered such operations worthwhile.
	- Women known to be anti-Soviet were never granted visas, regardless of their marital status.

4. **Historical Examples**:
	- **Nora Koryachenko**: Married a British diplomat in the 1940s and was coerced into working for Soviet State Security. She defected after leaving the USSR and provided intelligence to British authorities.
	- **Petr Deriabin**: A former State Security officer who defected in 1954, stated that Soviet women associating with foreigners were systematically recruited for espionage. Those allowed to leave the USSR were instructed to make mild anti-Soviet remarks abroad to maintain appearances.

5. **Parental Concerns**:
	- In one case, the father of an American man seeking to marry a Soviet woman contacted the State Department for advice. The official reiterated the challenges and risks associated with such marriages, emphasizing the likelihood of espionage involvement.

#### Conclusion:
The Soviet government tightly controlled marriages between their nationals and foreigners, often using such relationships as a tool for intelligence operations. Exit visas were rarely granted without significant delays or conditions, and individuals involved in these marriages faced numerous challenges.

It is believed that the Counterintelligence (Kontrrazvedka) division of the KGB initiates operations against foreigners inside the USSR. When such operations extend beyond the USSR into foreign countries—typically after the recruitment of targets—the operation is handed over to the Foreign Intelligence Directorate (Inostrannoye Upravleniye, INU), which continues the operation until its conclusion.

### Example Case: John Sandor
- **Timeline**:
	- Proposed to Viktoriya Kochetkova in 1956 but had to leave the USSR before they could marry.
	- Returned in 1957, married her in May, and they arrived together in the U.S. in March 1958.

### Observations
- The transition of operations from domestic to foreign intelligence highlights the structured approach of the KGB in managing foreign interactions.
- Recruitment and surveillance often continued even after individuals left the USSR.
